PoSh-ACME was originally created to be a script that used WMI for remote collection of data using just native commands. Its limitiations was that it primarily ran all commands against all targets with limited feedback. It has since then grown to havea GUI, which allows for easy selection of indiviual commands and targets. It's features are growing as requests come in, leading to the inclusion of some Sysinternals tools.

As the name indicates, PoSh-ACME is writen in PowerShell. The GUI utilizes the .net frame work to access Windows built in WinForms.
